Welcome to Chem2Blender's documentation!
==============================================
**Chem2Blender** (formerly known as **Gaussian-2-Blender**) is an API to convert .com input files from various sources
into 3D models ready to be used in Blender, Maya, Unity, Unreal, and other programs for 3D modeling.

- Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information on how to use the program.
- Check out the :doc:`tutorial` section for stepwise examples on how to use the program for various applications.
- Check out the :doc:`developers` section if you plan to extend the functionality of the program.
- Check out the :doc:`gui` section to see all the scripts and modules to build the program's graphical user interface.
- Check out the :doc:`api` section to see all the scripts and modules that handle the creation of 3D models in Blender

.. note::
	**Gaussian-2-Blender** *V.2022.6* was published at the *Journal of Chemical Education*. The program is currently
	undergoing updates to implement changes suggested by users. The objective of the current changes is to submit
	the updated version to the *Journal of Cheminformatics*.  This documentation is for **Chem2Blender** *V.2025.2*, 
   which is the next step in the life cycle of the program. I decided to implement more input files than only _Gaussian_.
